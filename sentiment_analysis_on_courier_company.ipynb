provider, City-Link Express (M) Sdn Bhd, recently took delivery of a large fleet of new Isuzu trucks. City-Link, one of Isuzu Malaysia Sdn Bhd’s key customers, had purchased the 277 units of various light duty, medium duty and prime mover trucks via Isuzu dealer Jumbo Arena Sdn Bhd.This is not the first time City-Link has taken delivery of a large fleet of Isuzu trucks, having done so in previous years as well. And with this latest truck delivery, City-Link Express is also the first Malaysian customer of Isuzu’s to own the Isuzu Safety Plus trucks. The safety platform was recently launched by Isuzu Malaysia in early September.“We are extremely delighted to deliver the new Isuzu trucks to City-Link Express, one of our long-term valued customers in Malaysia. This delivery signifies Isuzu’s commitment in supporting City-Link Express on achieving its business objectives despite the current environment,” said Koji Nakamura, Chief Executive Officer, Isuzu Malaysia.“Our trucks are built with the Isuzu S.E.E Technology at its core, which represents safety, economy and environment to offer all our customers like City-Link Express the reliability, efficiency and versatility that they demand to help increase their business sustainability and output,” he added.A portion of the new light duty trucks delivered are equipped with the Isuzu Safety Plus platform. These are equipped with safety features including Anti-lock Braking System (ABS), Electronic Brake-force Distribution (EBD), Anti-Slip Regulator (ASR) and Supplemental Restraint System (SRS) Airbag.City-Link Express was founded in 1979 and is Malaysia’s first courier company. Today, it is one of the leading integrated express, last mile delivery companies with a prominent brand foothold. The delivery of the new Isuzu trucks is expected to further strengthen City-Link Express’ existing fleet and also support the growth of its business operations in Malaysia.“The exponential growth of e-commerce and increased consumer spending online that we have seen in recent years have spurred the demand for courier delivery services,” commented Ronald Tan, Chief Executive Officer, City-Link Express. “City-Link Express has been a trusted courier delivery company for decades and we continue to be fully committed to quality services by ensuring our customers’ goods reach the intended destinations on-time and in good condition,” he added.To support its growing business volume, City-Link Express requires a fleet of trucks that are reliable, safe and easy-to-maintain. “In our line of business, we need trucks that can go the distance with us, as well as on having attentive and quick-to-respond aftermarket support. These are very important as we are in the business of speed and meeting delivery deadlines safely. We have been using Isuzu trucks for 10 years now and have been very satisfied on all these aspects, thus the decision to procure the additional trucks,” he shared.Tan also added that Isuzu offers City-Link Express the most cost-effective solutions. Its trucks are fuel-efficient and the cost for parts, services and maintenance are competitively priced, which helps the company reduce its operational costs. Further, the company finds the black box feature useful in tracking its trucks for better efficiency and safety.”The user-friendliness and drivability of Isuzu trucks make our drivers’ job easier too. This results in less fatigue and downtime, and increased productivity and efficiency. In return, this has helped us in retaining the good drivers we have, as well as in attracting new recruits,” he said.A vehicle handover ceremony was held recently at Dataran City-Link Express in Jenjarom, Selangor. “We are very honoured to know that City-Link Express has been reaping the benefits of using Isuzu trucks and has expressed great satisfaction with our brand. This handover truly highlights a business relationship built upon Isuzu’s brand promise, product quality and strong aftermarket support. We are highly appreciative of the level of trust City-Link Express continues to give us,” said Koji Nakamura.\n","PETALING JAYA: In a move to strengthen the local postal and courier industry that is rife with challenges, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) will not issue any new courier licences for two years.Additionally, a new action plan will be drafted by the National Postal and Courier Laboratory Laboratory (NPCIL) to propose measures to support the strategic development of the new postal and courier industry.In a press release yesterday, MCMC said the moratorium was implemented to allow the government, along with postal and courier players, to address the various industry challenges stemming from technological changes and market trends.This move is in line with the call made last August by the Association of Express Shipping Companies Malaysia (Amec), which comprises 25 major courier companies in Malaysia.Amec members include Pos Malaysia Bhd , GD Express Sdn Bhd, City-Link Express (M) Sdn Bhd, among others.The freezing of new courier licenses will run from Sept 14,2020 until Sept 15,2022, during which new licence applications of all categories to carry out courier services will not be accepted.“Applications received before the effective date of the moratorium and applications for renewal of existing licences will be processed for approval. As of October, there are 109 multi-category courier service licencees operating in Malaysia, ” said MCMC.Meanwhile, the process of drafting a new action plan by NPCIL will take three weeks, from Nov 2 to Nov 22, subject to the conditional movement control order (CMCO) by the government.“NPCIL results are important for this industry, which is at the core of e-commerce activities and digital economic development. The postal and courier industry faces various new challenges triggered by the technological boom, which has resulted in the merger of the logistics sector, e-commerce platform, e-hailing as well as financial transaction systems.“The last study on the postal and courier industry was conducted in 2009, ” said MCMC.Amec president Teong Teck Lean, who is also managing director and CEO of GD Express Carrier Bhd, lauded MCMC’s decision to freeze the application of new courier licences.“This is a good starting point and a positive move for the industry, as MCMC is also involving all stakeholders of the postal and courier industry, (from government agencies, courier service providers to the public), to work together to find the right formula to strengthen the industry.“By freezing applications, it will be easier to assess the current situation and decide on the necessary conditions to be implemented for the industry to self-regulate, ” said Teong, adding that the ultimate goal was for the postal and courier industry to be sustainable, reliable and efficient and be able to support the growth of e-commerce in Malaysia and the region.Given the sizeable figure of 109 licence holders, Teong felt that market consolidation could occur naturally, in time to come.As clearer regulations are outlined and sustainable measures put in place, he said such consolidations could then be carried out in a more professional and orderly manner, resulting in a win-win situation for all stakeholders.\n","CITY-LINK EXPRESS AIMS FOR FAST DELIVERY AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION WITH ISUZUStanding from left to right: Mr. Colin Tan (Sales Manager, City-Link Express), Mr. Ronald Tan (Chief Executive Officer, City-Link Express), Dato’ David Tan (Founder and Executive Chairman, City-Link Express), Mr. Koji Nakamura (Chief Executive Officer, Isuzu Malaysia Sdn Bhd), Mr. Atsunori Murata (Chief Operating Officer, Commercial Vehicle Division, Isuzu Malaysia Sdn Bhd) and Mr. Daniel Lee (Director, PTM Accel Sdn Bhd).Isuzu Malaysia recently delivered a total of 141 units of their commercial trucks to City-Link Express (M) Sdn Bhd, during an official handover ceremony held at City-Link Express’ ‘Super Hub’ facility in Bandar Saujana Putra, Selangor.

GDEX Bhd lays claim to being one of the first courier companies to tap into the e-commerce boom, way before the current coronavirus pandemic began.It has created myGDEX, an online shipping platform and a cloud-based call centre as well as an interactive voice response (IVR) support system. GDEX had also developed platforms such as deKat, a social commerce supply chain platform for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and a last-mile delivery platform (KITA) targeted at that segment too.GDEX managing director and group CEO Teong Teck Lean (pic below) expects the boom in e-commerce to continue, driven by migration of businesses from offline to online, especially in the business-to-business (B2B) segment. This will continue to be the driver for GDEX’s parcel volume growth, moving forward.“Our digital initiatives will make Gdex more cost-efficient without compromising on service quality. Gdex will come out with more product offerings and expand into new revenue streams, ” he tells StarBizWeek.The new platforms such myGDEX would not only strengthen the group’s operations but will also allow GDEX to tap into the business-to-consumer (B2C) and consumer-to-consumer (C2C) segments, Teong points out.“While the B2B segment is the company’s bread and butter, we foresee B2C and C2C to register higher growth as compared to the B2B segment. “We also plan to grow our warehouse fulfilment business, which offers customised end-to-end solutions. “We will continue to develop new products to cater for new trends, especially in the social commerce space, ” Teong says.In December, GDEX partnered with Tasco Bhd to create a comprehensive logistics service as both companies have different strengths. Both companies have signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MoU) to finalise this plan. Tasco will be given the priority to leverage GDEX’s last-mile fulfilment capabilities, while GDEX can tap into Tasco’s international logistics network as well as its local cold supply chain infrastructure and convenience retail logistics network.Interestingly, Tasco, which is a leading cold-chain logistics player, has said that it is ready to support the local distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. When asked if GDEX sees a potential collaboration with Tasco for vaccine logistics, Teong says: “We are open to that if the opportunity arises. With our extensive network and system in place, we believe we can assist the government in distributing the vaccines provided that the packages meet our delivery requirements.” GDEX currently handles the transporting of time-sensitive medical samples for chains of hospitals and clinics.Teong says that for this year, GDEX has allocated between RM20mil and RM30mil to upgrade the facilities at its hubs and for IT development. Both Tasco and GDEX have companies from Japan as their major shareholders. Tasco is a 55.38%-owned subsidiary of Japan’s Yusen Logistics Co Ltd, while Japan-based express delivery giant Yamato Holdings Co Ltd holds a 22.83% stake in GDEX.The collaboration with Tasco could also help GDEX face the massive competition in the delivery segment, which has led to price wars. To date, there are 110 licensed courier companies in the country. However, the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission has recently announced a two-year freeze on the issuance of new courier service licences. GDEX is in a net cash position of close to RM80mil, with almost zero borrowings.For the first quarter ended Sept 30,2020, GDEX posted a 51% rise in net profit to RM7.2mil from RM4.8mil a year earlier due to increasing demand from online business activities. Its logistics and warehousing services also did well. The group also attributed the growth to its operational efficiencies as a result of the digitalisation of internal systems and processes.Teong expects the e-commerce industry to continue growing post-pandemic and that the company’s digital initiatives will make GDEX more cost-efficient without compromising on its service quality. “We aim to become known as a digital company, ” he says.\n","KUALA LUMPUR (Bernama) -- GD Express Sdn Bhd (GDSB), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GD Express Carrier Bhd (GDEX), will expand its warehouses, distribution centres and transportation fleet to cater to the tremendous increase in order volumes following the booming Malaysian e-commerce market.The project, which began on Nov 1, is expected to create more than 1,000 employment opportunities for Malaysians, GDEX and the Malaysian Investment Development Authority (MIDA) said in a joint statement today.\"Further expanding the existing capacity, GDEX Group also intends to diversify its information technology infrastructure systems to efficiently support its operation in the regions for the next five years.\"This novel system will include the future use of DeKAT (social commerce supply chain) to extend the logistics services and create a seamless supply chain facility to the small and medium enterprises (SMEs), social entrepreneurs and fulfilment houses;

For employees who have worked for less than a year, bonuses are paid according to the length of working time without prejudice.“Unfortunately, certain employees are not clear about the bonus payment scheme which led to violent sorting of packages on February 4, inciting some employees to make collective disturbances and posting the videos to social media,” the company said in a press statement.J&T said that the viral video happened at its Perak branch, adding that the incident has been resolved. The management said it is also willing to be inspected by the authorities and undergo supervision.It said the employees resumed work as usual on February 5 and gave assurances that parcels will be processed and delivered to its customers.J&T acknowledged some of the complaints made on social media, purportedly by some of its customers who claimed their packages were opened and damaged prior to arrival or that the contents were missing.The management promised compensation for the damaged goods.“This is indeed a fault in our management. We have formulated special regulations and management methods for settlement of claims and supervision of similar incidents, and fast settlement of lost packages. We are grateful to the public for their love and support for J&T,” it said.The company also said that better training will be provided for its staff in dealing with packages.\n","Over the past few weeks, there have been several issues surrounding parcel delivery service J&T Express.Among those that made headlines include delay of the buyer receiving their ordered items, damaged goods to the most recent controversy regarding the staff strike. Therefore, it’s safe to say that the hot issues have taken a huge toll on a lot of people, and as a result, most of them opted to switch to other delivery services instead.The case is apparent as seen in this TikTok clip, posted by Twitter user @CahayaSakinah_, featuring a J&T staff showing his delivery truck, which now only carries a few boxes of goods. As stated in the video, the delivery men would usually deliver up to 100 to 150 parcels per day. However, after the issues went viral, they only deliver about 20 to 30 items to shoppers.The replies section has been flooded with mixed reactions left by netizens on Twitter. @JalalMisai_2 expressed, “The issue involving J&T the other day proved that consumer power is functioning well and it also gave a strong reminder to similar competing businesses. Improve and increase your quality. Maximise customers’ satisfaction again. It’s not impossible to get back on track, as long as there are improvements.”ADVERTISEMENTAnother Twitter user @imran_ajmaiin left a negative remark, saying, “They broke our trust. What can they expect from that? Many suffered losses because their parcels were either lost or damaged. My family lost RM3k because of the smashed parcels. Just imagine, even a hard tupperware could also break?”Feel free to read some of the comments left by Twitterverse citizens below:Do you guys think J&T Express deserve a second chance from Malaysians?\n","NewsA. | Feb 8, 2021, 14:33 | 133Following the viral video of J&T Express delivery workers vandalizing parcels and packages, Malaysians have begun to shun the courier company, vowing to boycott and shift their loyalty to the company‘s competitors instead. Yet amidst all the chaos, one particular Malaysian woman stepped out in the open to defend the company in question. This is what Facebook user Alice Ng wrote in her post:Translation:“Do not paint with the same brush! For sure that you have seen plenty of negative feedbacks towards JNT lately, including the comments on the workers eating or damaging the parcels, but these are all individuals' faults, and regarding the pay issue, a company as big as J&T should have properly taken care of it already.source: Alice NgIt is true that the delay in parcel delivery is making us frustrated, and I too feel the same. But let’s not forget their good sides. I am a seller, and sometimes the parcels that I send out in the evening get delivered to my customers the very next morning. They’ve done better than we expected, sending parcels at an incredible speed. So why have we forgotten these good moments?source: Alice NgAs a seller, I do hope my customers continue to choose J&T delivery service, because their delivery speed is really fast. Maybe the fact that CNY season is near that causes the delivery speed to be a little bit slower than usual.There are plenty of delivery services out there, and they all face similar issues. Perhaps J&T is more popular that’s why it is bound to get more attention.source: Alice NgI’m not sure how J&T operates in other states, but in Melacca, they have done an amazing job so far. I have used J&T’s delivery service for more than two years now and I will still be using it no matter what. Delivering parcels is a tough job, collecting parcels, carrying them, and delivering them are exhausting. On the other hand, we are just sitting at home waiting for our parcels to be delivered to our hands. So please, just because you have dealt with unpleasant delivery workers before, don't assume all the other workers from the same company behave the same.I’m not paid to say these things, but in fact, I am paying them thousands of ringgit each month to help me deliver my goods. I am just hoping to help these delivery men to remind people that not all delivery men are the same.”Perhaps Alice is right, and we should give this company the benefit of the doubt. After all, J&T has already issued an apology regarding the issue.However, all things considered; which side would you choose?\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"aP-0Zu2zh2rz","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622194856877,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":6085,"user":{"displayName":"TONG BOON ONN","photoUrl":"","userId":"18205139970556394169"}},"outputId":"02361fe4-39d8-41ed-ca26-6c1fe68fd006"},"source":["dhl = atc(\"https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/tech-digitalisation-way-forward-dhl-express\")\n","dhl1 = atc(\"https://www.malaymail.com/news/money/2021/04/08/maskargo-eyes-higher-market-share-with-new-service/1964818\")\n","dhl2 = atc(\"https://postandparcel.info/129957/news/e-commerce/dhl-in-malaysia-were-bolstering-our-network-of-depots-across-the-country/\")\n","print(dhl)\n","print(dhl1)\n","print(dhl2)"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["ALTHOUGH globalisation has been hit hard because of the Covid-19 pandemic, it has had a different effect on DHL Express.Since the beginning of last year, the German package delivery giant most recognisable by its distinctive red-and-yellow corporate colours, has experienced a 50% surge in e-commerce shipments in Asia-Pacific, excluding China.In an interview with The Edge, DHL Express CEO John Pearson highlights that digitalisation will be a key focus area for the courier delivery specialist in tackling increased demand from e-commerce.Moreover, he says, the pandemic has presented the company with an opportunity to further improve its operational systems in terms of efficiency and resilience.“With the growing need for e-commerce and consumer expectations of parcel delivery, one of the main challenges to becoming a competitive brand in cross-border e-commerce is to ensure that the ever-growing number of parcels are delivered in the shortest time possible. This also includes tracking and managing the accuracy and consistency of delivery timings,” Pearson says.Owing to the complexity arising from multiple delivery hand-offs in each leg of the journey and unexpected issues that may arise during border clearance, the fulfilment of the package will require close cooperation between all stakeholders.“This will drive the need to adopt standardisation and digitalisation for cross-border e-commerce and make the entire process seamless. Truly embracing e-commerce as a business means ensuring a seamless customer experience end-to-end while navigating the increased complexity and aligning the various moving parts in the supply chain,” he stresses.DHL Express is the express delivery arm of German multinational logistics firm Deutsche Post AG, which is listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. With a market capitalisation of more than €50 billion (RM202.2 billion), Deutsche Post is about 20%-owned by KfW Bankengruppe, a state-owned development bank.According to its annual report 2019, Deutsche Post saw its consolidated net profit grow 26.4% to €2.623 billion in 2019, up from €2.075 billion in 2018.Its express division — whose global network spans more than 220 countries and territories and some 105,000 employees providing services to around 2.7 million customers — contributed a revenue of €17.101 billion in 2019, of which €6.097 billion, or a third, came from Asia-Pacific.In January last year, Pearson, a 58-year-old Briton, was appointed CEO of DHL Express, and thus appointed to the board of management of Deutsche Post. The express industry veteran has also had stints in the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia and Dubai, Singapore, the US and Belgium.Citing the DHL Global Connectedness Index 2020, Pearson points out that there had been an unprecedented collapse in people flows last year.“For example, a 70% decrease in the number of people travelling to foreign countries has strongly affected the index. Nevertheless, global connectedness overall has been surprisingly robust. It is unlikely to fall below levels seen during the 2008/09 global financial crisis,” he says.While globalisation has been negatively affected by Covid-19, he observes the current crisis has also shown how indispensable international connections are for maintaining prosperity and continuity.“Trade in goods has already recovered more than three quarters of its initial decline. And digital information flows have surged, as in-person contact went into the online world. This has boosted international internet traffic, phone calls and e-commerce,” he explains.While the pandemic has presented significant challenges, Pearson notes that trade has turned out to be a key lifeline for economies and healthcare systems during difficult times.“At DHL, we’ve had to redesign our network when lockdowns grounded commercial flights; we’ve had to find new routes and solutions when borders were closed. And when companies swung back into action after forced plant closures, we did all we could to ensure that they were stocked to restart production.”Despite the export bans early in the pandemic, Pearson says trade in products used to fight Covid-19 has boomed, and such a trend is likely to continue with the global rollout of Covid-19 vaccines.“This also makes me confident to expect a bright future for globalisation in the coming years. Will we see changes? Of course. Among other things, we might see less global business travel and much more e-commerce. But globalisation overall isn’t going away. As I like to say, it is too big to fail. People will want to continue to trade with each other.”Malaysia an important marketCommenting on DHL Express’ operations in Malaysia, Pearson says that, following the pandemic, he sees potential in the recovery of the country’s trade with other nations.“Given Malaysia’s trade is closely tied with China, a reinvigoration of this connection, together with the potential rise in regional supply networks, means the country could stand to quickly recover, starting with its export-oriented manufacturing sector, a strong contributor to the GDP (gross domestic product) at 21.46% of the total in 2019,” he says.“Suffice it to say, Malaysia is a very important market for us and we will continue to invest in our infrastructure and people in the country, strengthening our footprint to support the many local SMEs (small and medium enterprises) looking to reach customers globally.”A check with the Companies Commission of Malaysia (SSM) shows that DHL Express (M) Sdn Bhd generated a net profit of RM5.95 million, on revenues of RM659.618 million in the financial year ended Dec 31, 2019.It is worth noting that, for a country with a population of more than 30 million, Malaysia had 109 courier service licence holders operating as at October last year. This prompted the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission (MCMC) to halt the issue of new licences for courier services last year for a two-year period from September 2020.While acknowledging that there are indeed many players in the Malaysian courier industry, Pearson believes all serve distinct market segments that may be mutually exclusive to others.“DHL Express fills a niche space with our specialisation in inbound and outbound international express shipping, for instance, next-day delivery to major cities in Asia and Europe. In fact, we represent one of four business units in the larger DHL family, with our other business units dedicated to global forwarding, supply chain and e-commerce solutions,” he says.According to him, the prolonged period of restricted living conditions has further skewed consumer behaviour towards e-commerce compared with brick-and-mortar businesses.The greater demand for orders and speed may soon eclipse the capability of online retailers, presenting an opportunity for logistics providers to include fulfilment in their portfolio. As a result, there will be a higher concentration of logistics activity catering for pharmaceuticals, non-perishable foodstuff and other sectors that have remained relatively profitable throughout the crisis.“The diversity of our businesses reflects the untapped potential still possible in logistics. We see huge opportunities and will continue to invest in our infrastructure and people to enhance our product offerings in meeting the rapid sector development and demands of customers here. Our company has always been about finding growth and service expansion internally, and that remains our modus operandi moving into the future,” he says.New investments include an order for eight additional Boeing 777 freighters, with first deliveries scheduled for 2022.“The investment marks a further step in DHL Express’ expansion of its intercontinental air network to meet customer demand in fast-growing international express shipping markets,” the company announced in a media statement last Wednesday.\n","MASkargo chief executive officer Ibrahim Mohamed Salleh said the company’s air freight market share in Malaysia is currently at between 40 per cent and 50 per cent. — Bernama picSubscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on news you need to know.KUALA LUMPUR, April 8 ― MAB Kargo Sdn Bhd (MASkargo), the air cargo logistics arm of Malaysia Airlines, is eyeing for a higher market share following its newly-formed strategic partnership with international courier, DHL Express (M) Sdn Bhd (DHL).MASkargo chief executive officer Ibrahim Mohamed Salleh said the company’s air freight market share in Malaysia is currently at between 40 per cent and 50 per cent.“This is one of the potential (growth) areas that we are looking at because this service is very innovative, and will grow exponentially.“It will take awhile for the general public to understand and start thinking on how to utilise (this new service) .but once they get use to it, (and see that this service) is so convenient, it will just shoot up,” he told reporters after signing the partnership agreement with DHL here today.Also present was DHL Express Malaysia and Brunei managing director Julian Neo Poh Choon.The partnership agreement was for the MH Door-to-Door (MHD2D), a door-to-door delivery service which utilises a web portal to allow customers to get quotations, book for deliveries, pay online, print consignment notes and track shipments.DHL will provide the back-end services, namely picking up and delivering the goods to the recipients.This comprehensive end-to-end solution will be available to the public on www.mhd2d.com from April 24.Ibrahim said this new service would be one of the major innovations that the airline cargo industry will have.“MASkargo’s business model has always been based on the airport-to-airport concept.“However, the evolution of customers’ purchasing style and expectations for the delivery of goods purchased today has highlighted the need for us to be closer to our customers,” he added.He added that e-commerce products currently takes up around 10 per cent of the total freight capacity. ― Bernama\n","In Malaysia, DHL eCommerce Solutions, a division of Deutsche Post DHL Group (DPDHL Group), has recorded triple digit revenue growth in the third quarter, corroborating the tremendous growth of e-commerce in the region.Equally, the number of parcels that DHL eCommerce Solutions has been processing monthly in Malaysia has doubled to approximately 90,000 pieces per day from a year ago and is set to double again to approximately 200,000 pieces per day once the central hub facility in Puchong is automated in the first quarter of 2021.“Malaysia’s e-commerce sector is expected to grow at 24.7% in 2020 and will reach US$12.6 billion by 2024. This growth will only accelerate post-pandemic as businesses, small and large, move and scale online, and online shopping becomes increasingly second-nature to consumers,” said Kiattichai Pitpreecha, CEO of DHL eCommerce Solutions Southeast Asia. “We’re bolstering our network of depots across the country and investing in automation and digitalization to increase capacity, enhance efficiency and provide a seamless customer experience.”DHL eCommerce Solutions currently has 45 depots across Malaysia, which serve as consolidation and distribution centers for the surrounding community. The company added five new depots in 2020 and will be opening another 12 depots over the next six months. To strengthen its last-mile services in Malaysia, DHL eCommerce Solutions has also grown its retail service points to over 450 and will soon be introducing a retail app for consumers to book, track and find shipments, and deploying a chat-bot to facilitate inquiries.Anil Gautam, Managing Director of DHL eCommerce Solutions Malaysia added, “To deal with the changing market dynamics and keep pace with the expansion, we are actively recruiting with plans to increase our workforce by more than 60% by end 2021. We see massive opportunities in the Klang Valley region but are equally witnessing heightened activities in East Malaysia as online spending increases. I’m confident that these investments into our people, technology and network will position us well for the booming Internet economy that is driven by a fast-growing, engaged, young and mobile-first wave of consumers.”DHL eCommerce Solutions has also tailored its nationwide network to provide sellers and consumers with convenient pick-up and drop-off locations across Malaysia. Catering specifically to the C2C and B2C e-commerce market where cash capabilities and secure delivery are key, it has also introduced value-added products such as cash on delivery with daily
